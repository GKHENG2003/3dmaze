15th MAY 2004	|I think there is still one bug need to be fixed: 
Version 1.0.0	|  (a)Collision test fail if player presses for
		|     a longer time. Altough i can use bool
		|     to change the state of keypress, but i think 
		|     the main problem lying on CollisionXX() yet 
		|     I couldn't figure it out.
		|*p/s: The map is on the icon.  
-----------------------------------------------------------
19th JUNE 2004	|I think this game is almost bugless. 
Version 1.0.1	|  (a)Time-constrained.
		|  (b)Distance to destination added.  
		|  (c)Optimized and Debugged the code.
		|*p/s: If you have any example on 3D hit test,
		|      let me know so i can "copy" it.
